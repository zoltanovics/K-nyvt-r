<h2 id="types-of-web-services">Types of Web Services</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the conceptual level, a service is a software component provided
through a network-accessible endpoint. The service consumer and provider
use messages to exchange invocation request and response information in
the form of self-containing documents that make very few assumptions
about the technological capabilities of the receiver.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On a technical level, web services can be implemented in various ways.
The two types of web services discussed in this section can be
distinguished as "big" web services and "RESTful" web services.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following topics are addressed here:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="#GKCDG">"Big" Web Services</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="#GKCAW">RESTful Web Services</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="big-web-services">"Big" Web Services</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>JAX-WS provides the functionality for "big" web services,
which are described in <a href="jaxws.html#BNAYL">Chapter 31, "Building Web
Services with JAX-WS"</a>. Big web services use XML messages that follow
the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) standard, an XML language
defining a message architecture and message formats. Such systems often
contain a machine-readable description of the operations offered by the
service, written in the Web Services Description Language (WSDL), an XML
language for defining interfaces syntactically.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> JAX-WS is moved to Java SE 8 and is not included in the Java EE 8 platform. However, the JAX-WS API can still be used in EE applications.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The SOAP message format and the WSDL interface definition language have
gained widespread adoption. Many development tools, such as NetBeans
IDE, can reduce the complexity of developing web service applications.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A SOAP-based design must include the following elements.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A formal contract must be established to describe the interface that
the web service offers. WSDL can be used to describe the details of the
contract, which may include messages, operations, bindings, and the
location of the web service. You may also process SOAP messages in a
JAX-WS service without publishing a WSDL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The architecture must address complex nonfunctional requirements. Many
web service specifications address such requirements and establish a
common vocabulary for them. Examples include transactions, security,
addressing, trust, coordination, and so on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The architecture needs to handle asynchronous processing and
invocation. In such cases, the infrastructure provided by standards,
such as Web Services Reliable Messaging (WSRM), and APIs, such as
JAX-WS, with their client-side asynchronous invocation support, can be
leveraged out of the box.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="restful-web-services">RESTful Web Services</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Java EE, JAX-RS provides the functionality for Representational
State Transfer (RESTful) web services. REST is well suited for basic, ad
hoc integration scenarios. RESTful web services, often better integrated
with HTTP than SOAP-based services are, do not require XML messages or
WSDL service-API definitions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Project Jersey is the production-ready reference implementation for the
JAX-RS specification. Jersey implements support for the annotations
defined in the JAX-RS specification, making it easy for developers to
build RESTful web services with Java and the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because RESTful web services use existing well-known W3C and Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF) standards (HTTP, XML, URI, MIME) and have
a lightweight infrastructure that allows services to be built with
minimal tooling, developing RESTful web services is inexpensive and thus
has a very low barrier for adoption. You can use a development tool such
as NetBeans IDE to further reduce the complexity of developing RESTful
web services.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A RESTful design may be appropriate when the following conditions are
met.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The web services are completely stateless. A good test is to consider
whether the interaction can survive a restart of the server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A caching infrastructure can be leveraged for performance. If the data
that the web service returns is not dynamically generated and can be
cached, the caching infrastructure that web servers and other
intermediaries inherently provide can be leveraged to improve
performance. However, the developer must take care because such caches
are limited to the HTTP <code>GET</code> method for most servers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The service producer and service consumer have a mutual understanding
of the context and content being passed along. Because there is no
formal way to describe the web services interface, both parties must
agree out of band on the schemas that describe the data being exchanged
and on ways to process it meaningfully. In the real world, most
commercial applications that expose services as RESTful implementations
also distribute so-called value-added toolkits that describe the
interfaces to developers in popular programming languages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bandwidth is particularly important and needs to be limited. REST is
particularly useful for limited-profile devices, such as PDAs and mobile
phones, for which the overhead of headers and additional layers of SOAP
elements on the XML payload must be restricted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Web service delivery or aggregation into existing websites can be
enabled easily with a RESTful style. Developers can use such
technologies as JAX-RS and Asynchronous JavaScript with XML (Ajax) and
such toolkits as Direct Web Remoting (DWR) to consume the services in
their web applications. Rather than starting from scratch, services can
be exposed with XML and consumed by HTML pages without significantly
refactoring the existing website architecture. Existing developers will
be more productive because they are adding to something they are already
familiar with rather than having to start from scratch with new
technology.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>RESTful web services are discussed in <a href="jaxrs.html#GIEPU">Chapter 32,
"Building RESTful Web Services with JAX-RS"</a>. This chapter contains
information about generating the skeleton of a RESTful web service using
both NetBeans IDE and the Maven project-management tool.</p>
