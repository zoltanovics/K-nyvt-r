<h2 id="the-lifecycle-of-a-javaserver-faces-application">The Lifecycle of a JavaServer Faces Application</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The lifecycle of an application refers to the various stages of
processing of that application, from its initiation to its conclusion.
All applications have lifecycles. During a web application lifecycle,
common tasks are performed, including the following.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Handling incoming requests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decoding parameters</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modifying and saving state</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rendering web pages to the browser</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The JavaServer Faces web application framework manages lifecycle phases
automatically for simple applications or allows you to manage them
manually for more complex applications as required.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>JavaServer Faces applications that use advanced features may require
interaction with the lifecycle at certain phases. For example, Ajax
applications use partial processing features of the lifecycle (see
<a href="jsf-intro008.html#GKNOJ">Partial Processing and Partial Rendering</a>).
A clearer understanding of the lifecycle phases is key to creating
well-designed components.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A simplified view of the JavaServer faces lifecycle, consisting of the
two main phases of a JavaServer Faces web application, is introduced in
<a href="jsf-intro004.html#GJAAM">A Simple JavaServer Faces Application</a>. This
section examines the JavaServer Faces lifecycle in more detail.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="overview-of-the-javaserver-faces-lifecycle">Overview of the JavaServer Faces Lifecycle</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The lifecycle of a JavaServer Faces application begins when the client
makes an HTTP request for a page and ends when the server responds with
the page, translated to HTML.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The lifecycle can be divided into two main phases: Execute and Render.
The Execute phase is further divided into subphases to support the
sophisticated component tree. This structure requires that component
data be converted and validated, component events be handled, and
component data be propagated to beans in an orderly fashion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A JavaServer Faces page is represented by a tree of components, called a
view. During the lifecycle, the JavaServer Faces implementation must
build the view while considering the state saved from a previous
submission of the page. When the client requests a page, the JavaServer
Faces implementation performs several tasks, such as validating the data
input of components in the view and converting input data to types
specified on the server side.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The JavaServer Faces implementation performs all these tasks as a series
of steps in the JavaServer Faces request-response lifecycle.
<a href="#BNAQR">Figure 7-3</a> illustrates these steps.</p>
</div>
<div id="BNAQR" class="paragraph">
<div class="title"><strong>Figure 7-3 JavaServer Faces Standard Request-Response Lifecycle</strong></div>
<p><span class="image"><img src="img/javaeett_dt_016.png" alt="Flow diagram of Faces request and Faces response, including event and validation processing, error handling, model updating, application invocation."></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The request-response lifecycle handles two kinds of requests: initial
requests and postbacks. An initial request occurs when a user makes a
request for a page for the first time. A postback request occurs when a
user submits the form contained on a page that was previously loaded
into the browser as a result of executing an initial request.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the lifecycle handles an initial request, it executes only the
Restore View and Render Response phases, because there is no user input
or action to process. Conversely, when the lifecycle handles a postback,
it executes all of the phases.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Usually, the first request for a JavaServer Faces page comes in from a
client, as a result of clicking a link or button component on a
JavaServer Faces page. To render a response that is another JavaServer
Faces page, the application creates a new view and stores it in the
<code>javax.faces.context.FacesContext</code> instance, which represents all of the
information associated with processing an incoming request and creating
a response. The application then acquires object references needed by
the view and calls the <code>FacesContext.renderResponse</code> method, which
forces immediate rendering of the view by skipping to the
<a href="#BNAQX">Render Response Phase</a> of the lifecycle, as is shown by the
arrows labelled Render Response in <a href="#BNAQR">Figure 7-3</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes, an application might need to redirect to a different web
application resource, such as a web service, or generate a response that
does not contain JavaServer Faces components. In these situations, the
developer must skip the Render Response phase by calling the
<code>FacesContext.responseComplete</code> method. This situation is also shown in
, with the arrows labelled Response Complete.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most common situation is that a JavaServer Faces component submits a
request for another JavaServer Faces page. In this case, the JavaServer
Faces implementation handles the request and automatically goes through
the phases in the lifecycle to perform any necessary conversions,
validations, and model updates and to generate the response.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is one exception to the lifecycle described in this section. When
a component&#8217;s <code>immediate</code> attribute is set to <code>true</code>, the validation,
conversion, and events associated with these components are processed
during the <a href="#BNAQT">Apply Request Values Phase</a> rather than in a
later phase.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The details of the lifecycle explained in the following sections are
primarily intended for developers who need to know information such as
when validations, conversions, and events are usually handled and ways
to change how and when they are handled. For more information on each of
the lifecycle phases, download the latest JavaServer Faces Specification
documentation from <code><a href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=372" class="bare">https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=372</a></code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The JavaServer Faces application lifecycle Execute phase contains the
following subphases:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="#BNAQS">Restore View Phase</a></p>
</li>
<li>

</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="restore-view-phase">Restore View Phase</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a request for a JavaServer Faces page is made, usually by an
action, such as when a link or a button component is clicked, the
JavaServer Faces implementation begins the Restore View phase.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During this phase, the JavaServer Faces implementation builds the view
of the page, wires event handlers and validators to components in the
view, and saves the view in the <code>FacesContext</code> instance, which contains
all the information needed to process a single request. All the
application&#8217;s components, event handlers, converters, and validators
have access to the <code>FacesContext</code> instance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the request for the page is an initial request, the JavaServer Faces
implementation creates an empty view during this phase and the lifecycle
advances to the Render Response phase, during which the empty view is
populated with the components referenced by the tags in the page.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the request for the page is a postback, a view corresponding to this
page already exists in the <code>FacesContext</code> instance. During this phase,
the JavaServer Faces implementation restores the view by using the state
information saved on the client or the server.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="apply-request-values-phase">Apply Request Values Phase</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After the component tree is restored during a postback request, each
component in the tree extracts its new value from the request parameters
by using its <code>decode</code> (<code>processDecodes()</code>) method. The value is then
stored locally on each component.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If any <code>decode</code> methods or event listeners have called the
<code>renderResponse</code> method on the current <code>FacesContext</code> instance, the
JavaServer Faces implementation skips to the Render Response phase.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If any events have been queued during this phase, the JavaServer Faces
implementation broadcasts the events to interested listeners.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If some components on the page have their <code>immediate</code> attributes (see
<a href="jsf-page002.html#BNARI">The immediate Attribute</a>) set to <code>true</code>, then
the validations, conversions, and events associated with these
components will be processed during this phase. If any conversion fails,
an error message associated with the component is generated and queued
on <code>FacesContext</code>. This message will be displayed during the Render
Response phase, along with any validation errors resulting from the
Process Validations phase.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At this point, if the application needs to redirect to a different web
application resource or generate a response that does not contain any
JavaServer Faces components, it can call the
<code>FacesContext.responseComplete</code> method.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the end of this phase, the components are set to their new values,
and messages and events have been queued.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the current request is identified as a partial request, the partial
context is retrieved from the <code>FacesContext</code>, and the partial processing
method is applied.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="process-validations-phase">Process Validations Phase</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During this phase, the JavaServer Faces implementation processes all
validators registered on the components in the tree by using its
<code>validate</code> (<code>processValidators</code>) method. It examines the component
attributes that specify the rules for the validation and compares these
rules to the local value stored for the component. The JavaServer Faces
implementation also completes conversions for input components that do
not have the <code>immediate</code> attribute set to true.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the local value is invalid, or if any conversion fails, the
JavaServer Faces implementation adds an error message to the
<code>FacesContext</code> instance, and the lifecycle advances directly to the
Render Response phase so that the page is rendered again with the error
messages displayed. If there were conversion errors from the Apply
Request Values phase, the messages for these errors are also displayed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If any <code>validate</code> methods or event listeners have called the
<code>renderResponse</code> method on the current <code>FacesContext</code>, the JavaServer
Faces implementation skips to the Render Response phase.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At this point, if the application needs to redirect to a different web
application resource or generate a response that does not contain any
JavaServer Faces components, it can call the
<code>FacesContext.responseComplete</code> method.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If events have been queued during this phase, the JavaServer Faces
implementation broadcasts them to interested listeners.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the current request is identified as a partial request, the partial
context is retrieved from the <code>FacesContext</code>, and the partial processing
method is applied.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="update-model-values-phase">Update Model Values Phase</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After the JavaServer Faces implementation determines that the data is
valid, it traverses the component tree and sets the corresponding
server-side object properties to the components' local values. The
JavaServer Faces implementation updates only the bean properties pointed
at by an input component&#8217;s <code>value</code> attribute. If the local data cannot
be converted to the types specified by the bean properties, the
lifecycle advances directly to the Render Response phase so that the
page is re-rendered with errors displayed. This is similar to what
happens with validation errors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If any <code>updateModels</code> methods or any listeners have called the
<code>renderResponse</code> method on the current <code>FacesContext</code> instance, the
JavaServer Faces implementation skips to the Render Response phase.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At this point, if the application needs to redirect to a different web
application resource or generate a response that does not contain any
JavaServer Faces components, it can call the
<code>FacesContext.responseComplete</code> method.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If any events have been queued during this phase, the JavaServer Faces
implementation broadcasts them to interested listeners.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the current request is identified as a partial request, the partial
context is retrieved from the <code>FacesContext</code>, and the partial processing
method is applied.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="invoke-application-phase">Invoke Application Phase</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During this phase, the JavaServer Faces implementation handles any
application-level events, such as submitting a form or linking to
another page.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At this point, if the application needs to redirect to a different web
application resource or generate a response that does not contain any
JavaServer Faces components, it can call the
<code>FacesContext.responseComplete</code> method.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the view being processed was reconstructed from state information
from a previous request and if a component has fired an event, these
events are broadcast to interested listeners.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, the JavaServer Faces implementation transfers control to the
Render Response phase.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="render-response-phase">Render Response Phase</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During this phase, JavaServer Faces builds the view and delegates
authority to the appropriate resource for rendering the pages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If this is an initial request, the components that are represented on
the page will be added to the component tree. If this is not an initial
request, the components are already added to the tree and need not be
added again.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the request is a postback and errors were encountered during the
Apply Request Values phase, Process Validations phase, or Update Model
Values phase, the original page is rendered again during this phase. If
the pages contain <code>h:message</code> or <code>h:messages</code> tags, any queued error
messages are displayed on the page.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After the content of the view is rendered, the state of the response is
saved so that subsequent requests can access it. The saved state is
available to the Restore View phase.</p>
